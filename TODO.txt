Source control is harder than programming the damn game.

Done
-Spawned in an Alien, and on sight it follows the person it sees.


TODO
-Player 2 cant destroy consumables.
-Computer buttons arent replicating across the server...
-If you try and run the game from the 'EscapeLevel' UE4 will crash, make sure you have the 'Menu' Level loaded.
